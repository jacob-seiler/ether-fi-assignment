## General and Solution
* Setup a new github repository 
* Email chuck@ether.fi with subject:  `Coding Challenge: <your name>` and a link to the repository
* Include a README.md that describes how to run and test your solution
* PLEASE do not spend more than 4 hours on this.  We can go over what's completed.

## Task: Develop a simple dApp that allows users to create and manage a list of tasks using the Ethereum blockchain.
## Use Foundry or Hardhat and a local development node(s) to fulfill the following requirements:
 
* Allow users to create a new task and assign it a `name`, `description`, and `due date` 
* Allow users to `view` a list of all tasks, `sorted` by due date. 
* Allow users to `mark` a task as complete and `remove` it from the list.
* The dApp should `use the Ethereum blockchain` to store the list of tasks.
* Include a basic user interface that allows users to interact with the dApp.
